This is a burp extension having as goal to generate the Burp scanner report.

The extension will start a web server on a specific port and the report
will be available on a specific url.


Parameters to customize the execution:
* scanner.report.port = the port on which the (extension) web server will listen.
  If no port is specified then a port will be computed automatically.
  The computed port will be MAX(ports of proxy listeners) + 1.

* scanner.report.url = the url on which the report is accessible. If no url is specified then
  the default url will be used ("/scanner/report").

Usage example (Starts the web server extension on port 8085 under the url "/abc"):
java -jar -Xmx2g -Dscanner.report.port=8085 -Dscanner.report.url=/abc burpsuite_pro_v1.6.39.jar

Parameters to customize the output:
* output=XML - the output will be in XML format.
* output=HTML - the output will be in HTML format.
* no output parameter then the HTML report will be generated.

Requirements to run the extension:
* Java 8 or later; could easily be downgraded to Java 6.
* Burp Suite Professional version 1.6.39 (or later ?) - not sure that the next API
  versions will be backward compatible.
